# Rock Paper Scissors Game in C 🎮

Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors** game, a simple and interactive command-line game developed in **C**. This project is part of my university coursework and demonstrates fundamental programming skills in C. 


## About the Project 📜

This is a straightforward yet engaging project that simulates the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game. Users can play against the computer, with real-time win/loss/tie results displayed instantly. 

The game uses:
- **Random number generation** to create the computer's choice.
- **Control structures** for game logic.
- **Basic I/O functions** to interact with the player.

> **Why this project?**
> - Ideal for beginners learning C programming.
> - Demonstrates core concepts in C, such as functions, loops, and conditional statements.
> - Great for practicing logic building and problem-solving.

## Features 🌟
- **Simple CLI Interface**: A text-based interface that's easy to navigate.
- **Random Computer Choices**: Unpredictable opponent moves add to the excitement.
- **Score Tracking**: Shows live score updates after each round.

## How to Play 📋
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Compile and run the code on any C compiler.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
4. See if you can beat the computer!

## Setup 🔧
